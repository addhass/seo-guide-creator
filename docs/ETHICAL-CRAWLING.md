# Ethical Web Crawling Guidelines

## 🤝 Our Commitment

This tool implements responsible web crawling practices to respect website owners and comply with best practices.

## 🛡️ Protection Measures Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **10 requests per minute per domain** maximum
- Automatic rate limit tracking per domain
- Graceful waiting when limits are reached
- Prevents overwhelming servers

### 2. Respectful Delays
- **3-5 seconds random delay** between requests
- Mimics human browsing behavior
- Prevents rapid-fire requests
- Gives servers time to respond

### 3. Robots.txt Compliance
- Checks robots.txt before crawling
- Respects Disallow directives
- Identifies bot-specific rules
- Proceeds with caution if unavailable

### 4. User Agent Identification
- Uses legitimate browser user agents
- Rotates between different browsers
- Includes both desktop and mobile agents
- Never misrepresents the tool's purpose

### 5. Error Handling
- Gracefully handles 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Backs off on server errors
- Respects rate limit headers
- Never retries aggressively

## 📊 Implementation Details

### Rate Limiter
```javascript
// Per-domain tracking
rateLimiter = new Map()
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60000 // 1 minute
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN = 10
```

### Delay System
```javascript
MIN_DELAY = 3000 // 3 seconds
MAX_DELAY = 5000 // 5 seconds
// Random delay between requests
```

### Request Pattern
1. Check robots.txt (once per domain)
2. Verify rate limits before each request
3. Make request with proper headers
4. Wait 3-5 seconds before next request
5. Handle errors gracefully

## 🚫 What We Don't Do

- **No aggressive crawling** - We limit requests strictly
- **No bypassing protections** - We respect all barriers
- **No data hoarding** - We only collect what's needed
- **No selling data** - Educational/business use only
- **No hidden crawling** - Transparent user agents

## 💡 Best Practices for Users

1. **Test with your own site first** - Ensure the tool works correctly
2. **Crawl during off-peak hours** - Be considerate of server load
3. **Limit analysis scope** - Only analyze what you need
4. **Cache results** - Don't re-crawl unnecessarily
5. **Respect competitor privacy** - Use data ethically

## 🔧 Configuration Options

Users can adjust these settings in the code:
- `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN` - Lower for more conservative crawling
- `MIN_DELAY` / `MAX_DELAY` - Increase for slower crawling
- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` - Adjust the time window

## 📝 Legal Considerations

- This tool is for educational and competitive analysis only
- Users are responsible for compliance with local laws
- Respect website terms of service
- Don't use for malicious purposes
- Consider reaching out to sites before extensive crawling

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Approach Benefits

Using Claude AI for analysis means:
- Fewer requests needed (AI extracts more per page)
- Smarter crawling (AI identifies correct pages faster)
- Better data extraction (reduces need for multiple attempts)
- Respectful by design (built-in understanding of limits)

## 📞 Contact

If a website owner has concerns about this tool's crawling:
1. The tool respects robots.txt - update it to exclude paths
2. The tool has strict rate limits built in
3. Users can be instructed to exclude specific domains

Remember: **Good crawling is invisible crawling** - if a site notices you, you're doing it wrong!
