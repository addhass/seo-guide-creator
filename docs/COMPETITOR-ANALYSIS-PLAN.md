# Competitor Product Description Analysis - Project Plan

## üéØ Goal
Automatically analyze competitor product descriptions by:
1. Finding a Product Listing Page (PLP) for each competitor domain
2. Extracting 3 Product Detail Pages (PDPs) from the PLP
3. Scraping product descriptions from each PDP
4. Analyzing description characteristics (length, structure, tone)
5. Using insights to enhance guide generation

## üìä Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Research & Planning (Day 1)
#### 1.1 PLP Pattern Research
- [ ] Study common PLP URL patterns (/products, /shop, /collection, etc.)
- [ ] Document common PLP identifiers (HTML structure, CSS classes)
- [ ] Create test cases for 5 different e-commerce platforms

#### 1.2 PDP Pattern Research  
- [ ] Study common PDP URL patterns (/product/, /p/, item IDs)
- [ ] Document common product description selectors
- [ ] Identify description container patterns

#### 1.3 Data Structure Design
- [ ] Design JSON schema for competitor data storage
- [ ] Plan database structure for analysis results
- [ ] Create mockup of final data format

### Phase 2: PLP Discovery (Day 2-3)
#### 2.1 URL Pattern Matcher
- [ ] Create regex patterns for common PLP URLs
- [ ] Build URL validator function
- [ ] Test with known competitor domains

#### 2.2 Smart PLP Finder
- [ ] Implement sitemap.xml checker
- [ ] Create common path checker (/shop, /products, etc.)
- [ ] Build homepage link analyzer
- [ ] Add fallback Google search method

#### 2.3 PLP Validator
- [ ] Check for multiple product links
- [ ] Verify grid/list layout patterns
- [ ] Confirm it's not a single product page

### Phase 3: PDP Extraction (Day 4-5)
#### 3.1 Product Link Extractor
- [ ] Find all product links on PLP
- [ ] Filter out non-product links
- [ ] Implement smart link scoring

#### 3.2 Product Selector
- [ ] Select top 3 products (by position/popularity)
- [ ] Handle pagination if needed
- [ ] Ensure product diversity

#### 3.3 PDP Validator
- [ ] Verify each link is a valid PDP
- [ ] Check for product description presence
- [ ] Handle redirects and errors

### Phase 4: Description Scraping (Day 6-7)
#### 4.1 Description Finder
- [ ] Build smart description selector
- [ ] Handle various description formats
- [ ] Extract both short and long descriptions

#### 4.2 Content Cleaner
- [ ] Remove HTML tags appropriately
- [ ] Preserve important formatting
- [ ] Handle special characters

#### 4.3 Error Handling
- [ ] Implement retry logic
- [ ] Handle rate limiting
- [ ] Create fallback strategies

### Phase 5: Description Analysis (Day 8-9)
#### 5.1 Basic Metrics
- [ ] Count words and characters
- [ ] Measure paragraph count
- [ ] Calculate average sentence length

#### 5.2 Structure Analysis
- [ ] Identify description sections
- [ ] Detect bullet points vs paragraphs
- [ ] Find common patterns

#### 5.3 Tone Analysis
- [ ] Implement sentiment analysis
- [ ] Detect formality level
- [ ] Identify key descriptive words

### Phase 6: Integration (Day 10)
#### 6.1 Storage System
- [ ] Create competitor data storage
- [ ] Implement cache mechanism
- [ ] Build data retrieval functions

#### 6.2 UI Integration
- [ ] Add analysis status to competitor list
- [ ] Create description preview modal
- [ ] Show analysis insights

#### 6.3 Guide Enhancement
- [ ] Integrate insights into guide generation
- [ ] Add competitor comparison section
- [ ] Include best practices based on analysis

## üîß Technical Approach

### Tools & Technologies
- **Scraping**: Use existing proxy server infrastructure
- **AI Analysis**: Claude API for:
  - Intelligent PLP/PDP detection
  - Product description extraction
  - Structure and tone analysis
  - Pattern recognition across sites
- **Storage**: JSON files initially, upgrade to DB later
- **UI**: Extend existing competitor analysis module

### Key Challenges
1. **Dynamic content**: Many sites use JavaScript
2. **Anti-scraping**: Rate limits, bot detection
3. **Diverse structures**: Every site is different
4. **Performance**: Need to be fast but respectful

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Headless browser option**: For JS-heavy sites
2. **Smart delays**: Randomized, respectful timing
3. **Pattern library**: Build extensive selector database
4. **Caching**: Store results to minimize requests

## üìù Micro-Task Breakdown for Phase 1

### Tomorrow's Tasks (Ultra-Tiny)
1. Create `competitor-scraper.js` file in utils folder (5 min)
2. Write 5 example PLP URLs from different platforms (10 min)
3. Visit each URL and document the HTML structure (20 min)
4. Create a simple JSON schema for storing data (10 min)
5. Write pseudocode for PLP detection algorithm (15 min)

### Success Metrics
- Can identify PLP with 80% accuracy
- Can extract 3 valid PDPs from PLP
- Can scrape descriptions without errors
- Analysis provides actionable insights
- Integration enhances guide quality

## üöÄ MVP Scope (Week 1)
Focus on:
1. Finding PLPs for top 5 e-commerce platforms
2. Extracting 3 products successfully
3. Getting basic description text
4. Simple word count analysis

Leave for later:
- Advanced tone analysis
- Complex structure parsing
- Handling edge cases
- Beautiful UI integration
