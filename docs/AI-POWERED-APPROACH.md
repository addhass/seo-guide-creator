# AI-Powered Competitor Analysis Approach

## ü§ñ How AI (Claude) Will Help

### 1. Smart PLP Detection
Instead of complex regex patterns, we'll:
```javascript
// Send page HTML to Claude
const plpPrompt = `
Analyze this HTML and tell me:
1. Is this a Product Listing Page (PLP)?
2. What indicators suggest it's a PLP?
3. Extract all product URLs found
4. Rate confidence 1-10

HTML: ${pageHtml}
`;
```

### 2. Intelligent Product Selection
Let Claude pick the best products:
```javascript
const selectionPrompt = `
From these product URLs on the PLP:
${productUrls}

Select the 3 best products to analyze based on:
- Position on page (higher = more important)
- Product type diversity
- Likely to have good descriptions

Return as JSON: {selectedProducts: [...]}
`;
```

### 3. Description Extraction
No need for complex selectors:
```javascript
const extractionPrompt = `
Extract the product description from this page:
${productPageHtml}

Return:
1. Main product description
2. Bullet points/features
3. Technical specifications
4. Any additional product details

Format as JSON with clear sections.
`;
```

### 4. Advanced Analysis
Let Claude do the heavy lifting:
```javascript
const analysisPrompt = `
Analyze these 3 product descriptions from ${competitorDomain}:

${descriptions}

Provide insights on:
1. Average word count
2. Tone (formal/casual/technical)
3. Structure patterns
4. Unique selling points emphasized
5. SEO keyword usage
6. Emotional appeals used
7. Technical detail level

Summarize in actionable insights for writing similar descriptions.
`;
```

## üöÄ Simplified Phase 1 Tasks (Using AI)

### Day 1: Basic Setup
1. **Create competitor analysis endpoint** (30 min)
   - Add `/analyze-competitor-products` to proxy server
   - Set up Claude API integration for this feature

2. **Build simple test function** (20 min)
   - Input: competitor domain
   - Output: JSON with PLP URL and 3 product URLs

3. **Test with one competitor** (10 min)
   - Use a known fashion site
   - Verify AI can find PLP and products

### Day 2: Full Pipeline
1. **PLP Finder** (1 hour)
   - Try common paths (/shop, /products, /collection)
   - Send each to Claude for verification
   - Return first confirmed PLP

2. **Product Extractor** (45 min)
   - Get HTML of PLP
   - Ask Claude to extract product URLs
   - Limit to top 3

3. **Description Scraper** (45 min)
   - Fetch each product page
   - Ask Claude to extract descriptions
   - Store in structured format

### Day 3: Analysis & Integration
1. **Analysis Engine** (1 hour)
   - Send all descriptions to Claude
   - Get comprehensive analysis
   - Format for guide generation

2. **UI Integration** (30 min)
   - Add "Analyze Products" button to competitor section
   - Show loading state
   - Display results in modal

3. **Guide Enhancement** (30 min)
   - Add competitor insights section to guide prompt
   - Include tone and structure recommendations

## üí° Key Advantages of AI Approach

1. **No Complex Parsing**: Claude understands HTML context
2. **Adaptive**: Works across different site structures
3. **Intelligent**: Makes smart decisions about what to extract
4. **Insightful**: Provides analysis beyond basic metrics
5. **Maintainable**: No brittle selectors to update

## üìù Immediate Next Steps

1. Start with a proof of concept function
2. Test Claude's ability to identify PLPs
3. Iterate based on results
4. Build incrementally
