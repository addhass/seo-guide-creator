## Introduction {#introduction}

Welcome to your comprehensive content creation guide for Wild Donkey's website. This guide will help you create compelling, SEO-optimised content that captures Wild Donkey's unique vintage aesthetic while attracting customers searching for vintage and retro clothing.

### About This Guide {#about-this-guide}

This guide covers 14 key pages targeting keywords with a combined **664,390 monthly searches in the UK**. Each page has been carefully planned with specific keywords, meta data, and content strategies based on thorough competitor analysis and search behaviour.

### Understanding Traffic Potential {#understanding-traffic-potential}

Let's be transparent about what these numbers mean. The 664,390 represents total monthly searches for all target keywords in the UK market. Your actual traffic depends on where you rank:

| Ranking Position | Typical CTR\* | Potential Monthly Visits |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Position 1 | 28.5% | 189,351 visits |
| Position 2 | 15.7% | 104,309 visits |
| Position 3 | 11.0% | 73,083 visits |
| Position 4 | 8.0% | 53,151 visits |
| Position 5 | 7.2% | 47,836 visits |
| Position 6-10 | 3.5% avg | 23,254 visits |

**Important Caveats:**

- \*CTR (Click-Through Rate) data is based on industry averages before AI Overviews  
- Google's AI Overviews are changing the landscape and may reduce organic CTR  
- Competition, search intent, and SERP features affect actual CTR  
- These figures are UK-focused; international expansion would add opportunity  
- Realistic initial target: Achieving positions 3-5 would bring 30,000-75,000 visits/month

### Wild Donkey's Brand Voice {#wild-donkey's-brand-voice}

We've reviewed the Wild Donkey website and About Us page to understand the tone and personality conveyed across existing content. The following reflects the brand character as it currently stands.

Please keep this voice in mind when reviewing the beta copy recommendations throughout this guide. While there's room to adapt or evolve the tone where needed, bear in mind that our recommendations are also shaped by SEO considerations, striking a balance between visibility and authenticity.

**Brand Personality:**

- **Nostalgic & Storytelling**: Every piece has a story from the 50s, 60s, or 70s  
- **Artisanal & Authentic**: Emphasise handcrafted Italian quality and vintage-hunting origins  
- **Cool & Effortless**: Channel the spirit of American college students, Vietnam War soldiers expressing themselves through clothing, and motorcycle racers  
- **Passionate & Knowledgeable**: Show deep expertise in vintage Americana

**Key Messaging Pillars:**

1. **Made in Italy** \- Artisan craftsmanship from Pescara since 2016  
2. **Authentic Vintage Recreation** \- Faithful reproduction of iconic garments  
3. **Unique Aging Techniques** \- Each piece is individually treated by artisans  
4. **Global Vintage Inspiration** \- Hidden treasures discovered in markets worldwide inspire our recreations  
5. **Stories Behind Every Design** \- T-shirts as powerful mediums for self-expression

## 

## Part 1: Understanding Your Content Strategy {#part-1:-understanding-your-content-strategy}

### Why These Pages Matter {#why-these-pages-matter}

Your current website has significant opportunities to capture more organic traffic. The keyword data shows:

- **Total search volume**: 664,390 monthly searches (UK)  
- **Primary opportunity**: T-shirts (169,100) and Hoodies (157,700) collections  
- **Quick wins**: Improving existing collection page content  
- **Realistic goal**: Ranking positions 3-5 could deliver 30,000-75,000 monthly visits

### Strategic Collection Structure {#strategic-collection-structure}

**Important Note**: We've recommended splitting your current Accessories collection ([https://wilddonkeycompany.com/collections/accessories](https://wilddonkeycompany.com/collections/accessories)) into two separate collections:

1. **Caps Collection** (/collections/caps)  
2. **Tote Bags Collection** (/collections/tote-bags)

**Why This Split Makes Sense:**

**SEO Benefits:**

- **Targeted Keywords**: "Caps" has 32,990 monthly searches vs generic "accessories"  
- **Search Intent Match**: People searching "vintage caps" want caps, not a mixed accessories page  
- **Better Rankings**: Focused pages rank higher than broad category pages  
- **More Landing Pages**: Two optimised pages instead of one diluted page

**User Experience Benefits:**

- **Clearer Navigation**: Customers can go directly to what they want  
- **Better Product Showcase**: Caps deserve their own story and presentation  
- **Reduced Bounce Rate**: Visitors find exactly what they searched for

**Business Benefits:**

- **Caps have strong enough range**: Your cap collection can stand alone  
- **Future Growth**: Room to expand each category independently  
- **Cross-selling**: Can link between related collections

This strategic split could deliver an additional 5,000-6,000 visits/month at position 3, compared to a generic accessories page that would struggle to rank for specific terms.

### Breaking Down the Real Opportunity {#breaking-down-the-real-opportunity}

Here's where the traffic potential lies across all your pages:

| Page | Monthly Searches | At Position 3 (11% CTR) | At Position 5 (7.2% CTR) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T-Shirts | 169,100 | 18,601 visits | 12,175 visits |
| Hoodies | 157,700 | 17,347 visits | 11,354 visits |
| Jackets | 75,480 | 8,303 visits | 5,435 visits |
| Shirts | 55,370 | 6,091 visits | 3,987 visits |
| Trousers/Sweatpants | 54,820 | 6,030 visits | 3,947 visits |
| Sweatshirts | 47,870 | 5,266 visits | 3,447 visits |
| Caps | 32,990 | 3,629 visits | 2,375 visits |
| Tote Bags | 25,390 | 2,793 visits | 1,828 visits |
| Homepage | 24,420 | 2,686 visits | 1,758 visits |
| Knitwear/Sweaters | 20,500 | 2,255 visits | 1,476 visits |
| Sale | 490 | 54 visits | 35 visits |
| About Us | 260 | 29 visits | 19 visits |
| New Arrivals | 0 | 0 visits | 0 visits |
| FAQ | 0 | 0 visits | 0 visits |
| **Total All Pages** | **664,390** | **73,083 visits** | **47,836 visits** |

**Key Insights:**

- Your top 6 collections represent 84% of total search opportunity  
- Even smaller collections like Caps (32,990) and Tote Bags (25,390) offer meaningful traffic  
- Homepage organic opportunity exists beyond brand searches  
- Sale and About Us pages have minimal search volume but are essential for user experience  
- New Arrivals and FAQ pages serve navigation/support rather than search traffic

### Reading Your Keyword Data {#reading-your-keyword-data}

Each page in this guide includes specific keyword targets. Here's what the numbers mean:

- **Search Volume (e.g., "hoodies 74,000")**: Monthly UK searches for that exact term  
- **Traffic Reality**: You'll only capture a percentage based on your ranking  
- **Primary Keywords**: Use these 5-8 times naturally throughout your content  
- **Secondary Keywords**: Include these 2-4 times  
- **Long-tail Keywords**: Work these in where they fit naturally

**Remember**: These are UK figures only. Wild Donkey ships internationally, so global traffic potential is significantly higher.

### Content Structure for E-commerce {#content-structure-for-e-commerce}

Unlike service pages, e-commerce content needs to balance SEO with conversion. Your pages should aim to achieve:

1. **Inspire with storytelling** \- Connect products to vintage heritage  
2. **Inform with details** \- Sizes, materials, care instructions  
3. **Convert with urgency** \- Limited editions, handcrafted nature  
4. **Build trust** \- Italian craftsmanship, quality guarantees

### Key Findings from Competitor Analysis {#key-findings-from-competitor-analysis}

**Average Intro Copy Length: 50-150 words**

Our analysis of major UK fashion retailers revealed that successful collection pages use surprisingly concise intro copy. Here's what we found:

| Retailer | Collection Type | Word Count\* | Character Count\* | Approach |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [ASOS](https://www.asos.com/women/hoodies-sweatshirts/cat/?cid=11321) | Hoodies | 93 words | 609 characters | Focus on styling and brand mentions |
| [Next](https://www.next.co.uk/shop/gender-men-productaffiliation-sweatshirtsandhoodies-0) | Sweatshirts | 84 words | 564 characters | Seasonal approach with fabric focus |

\*Approximate figures based on collection page analysis

### Common Patterns in Successful Collection Pages {#common-patterns-in-successful-collection-pages}

#### 1\. **The Three-Part Opening Formula** {#1.-the-three-part-opening-formula}

Most high-ranking pages follow this structure:

- **Sentence 1**: Address the immediate need/occasion  
- **Sentence 2**: Highlight variety and choice  
- **Sentence 3**: Suggest styling or use cases

**Real Example \- Next Sweatshirts:** "Lighten up your layers with our refreshed collection of men's sweatshirts and hoodies, perfect for those longer, warmer evenings and cooler days. While still wardrobe staples, we've introduced lighter fabrics and updated styles to keep you comfortable and on-trend."

#### 2\. **Essential Elements Used by Top Retailers** {#2.-essential-elements-used-by-top-retailers}

**Variety Emphasis:**

- ASOS: "Browse cropped women's hoodies from COLLUSION or shop zip-up sweatshirts"  
- Next: "hooded, zip-through, and lightweight jumper styles"  
- House of Fraser: "from hooded options to long or short designs"

**Use Case Positioning:**

- InTheStyle: "Whether you're looking for an oversized hoodie for your Friday night in or a cropped sweater to run your errands in"  
- Superdry: "perfect for layering" / "luxurious addition for extra warmth"

**Brand Mentions:**

- ASOS: "with the likes of Nike and adidas Originals"  
- House of Fraser: "premium & designer brands like The North Face, Armani and Barbour"

### Why This Matters for Wild Donkey {#why-this-matters-for-wild-donkey}

The data shows that successful e-commerce collection pages:

1. **Get to the point quickly** \- Shoppers scan, they don't read  
2. **Focus on variety and choice** \- Reassure shoppers they'll find what they want  
3. **Include practical information** \- When/where to wear items  
4. **Naturally integrate keywords** \- Within conversational copy

### The Perfect Collection Page Structure for Wild Donkey {#the-perfect-collection-page-structure-for-wild-donkey}

Based on our competitor analysis and your current capabilities, here's the realistic structure for your collection pages:

#### Current Implementation (Phase 1): {#current-implementation-(phase-1):}

1. **H1 Heading** \- Your primary SEO title  
2. **H2 Subheading** \- Secondary messaging  
3. **Hero/Intro Copy** \- 100-150 words of compelling vintage storytelling

#### Why This Works: {#why-this-works:}

Our analysis shows major retailers succeed with minimal copy:

- ASOS: 93 words only  
- Next: 84 words only  
- Rains: 92 words only

Your 100-150 words allows for vintage storytelling while staying competitive.

#### Future Opportunity (Phase 2): The Case for Bottom-of-Page Content {#future-opportunity-(phase-2):-the-case-for-bottom-of-page-content}

**Research Findings**: Our analysis of successful fashion e-commerce sites reveals a proven SEO strategy that Wild Donkey should consider implementing in Phase 2\.

**Evidence from Industry Leaders:**

1. **John Mueller (Google's Search Relations Lead) confirms**:  
     
   "When the ecommerce category pages don't have any other content at all other than links to the products then it's really hard for us to rank those pages." Source: [Shopify Collection Page SEO Guide \- LOGEIX](https://logeix.com/shopify-seo/collection-pages)  
     
2. **Successful Implementation Examples**:  
     
   **Fashion/Sports Retailers Using Bottom Content:**  
     
   - **Sport Jackets Example** (mentioned in Centra.com): Major sportswear retailer includes extensive bottom-of-page content with keyword-rich descriptions  
   - **LOGEIX Case Study**: Shows 642 words at page bottom with 19 internal links, demonstrating successful implementation

   

   **Vintage Specialists Using Extended Content:**

   

   - [Thrifted.com](https://www.thrifted.com/collections/vintage-hoodies): 150+ words explaining vintage hoodie history, brands, eras, and origins  
   - [Mazeys UK](https://www.mazeys.co.uk/collections/t-shirts): 200+ words about mod culture, quality, and brand heritage  
   - [Butterworths Vintage](https://butterworthsvintage.com/collections/vintage-t-shirts-1): Emphasises authenticity and sourcing story

   

3. **Why This Strategy Works**:  
     
   **SEO Benefits:**  
     
   - Provides context for Google to understand page content  
   - Allows natural keyword integration without stuffing  
   - Creates opportunities for internal linking  
   - Differentiates from competitors with minimal content

   

   **User Benefits:**

   

   - Doesn't interfere with shopping (below product grid)  
   - Provides valuable information for interested shoppers  
   - Builds trust through expertise demonstration  
   - Answers common questions reducing support queries

   

4. **Recommended Bottom Content Structure for Wild Donkey**:  
     
   **Section 1: Collection Heritage Story**  
     
   - The vintage pieces that inspired this collection  
   - Cultural significance and era details  
   - Why these designs matter today

   

   **Section 2: Style & Fit Guide**

   

   - How Wild Donkey recreates authentic fits  
   - Sizing considerations due to aging treatments  
   - Styling suggestions for modern wear

   

   **Section 3: Craftsmanship Details**

   

   - Italian workshop process  
   - Unique aging techniques used  
   - Why each piece is different

   

   **Total: 250 words** positioned below the product grid

   

5. **Implementation Best Practices**:  
     
   - Use expandable accordions or tabs to keep page clean  
   - Include relevant internal links (3-5 per 100 words)  
   - Mobile-friendly formatting

**The Business Case**: While major retailers (ASOS, Next) succeed with minimal content due to domain authority, specialty vintage retailers consistently use extended content to compete. For Wild Donkey, this approach would:

- Target long-tail vintage keywords where you can realistically compete  
- Build topical authority around vintage fashion  
- Provide value that generic retailers can't match  
- Support higher prices through education

This phased approach lets you launch with competitive collection pages now, while planning for enhanced SEO content that has proven successful for similar vintage fashion retailers.

### 

### Homepage Content Structure Proposal {#homepage-content-structure-proposal}

Your homepage is more than just a landing page \- it's the digital storefront that tells your entire brand story in seconds. For Wild Donkey, this means balancing authentic vintage storytelling with the immediate needs of online shoppers.

While collection pages can focus on specific products, your homepage must achieve multiple goals:

* Establish your unique Italian-made, vintage-inspired identity  
* Guide visitors to the right collections  
* Build trust with new customers  
* Support SEO without compromising the shopping experience

The structure below is designed to achieve all these goals while maintaining the effortless, cool aesthetic that defines Wild Donkey. Each section has a specific purpose and recommended length based on e-commerce best practices and user behaviour research.

The homepage needs special treatment as your primary landing page:

#### 1\. **Hero Banner** (50-75 words) {#1.-hero-banner-(50-75-words)}

- Powerful brand statement  
- Include "vintage clothing" and "made in Italy"

#### 2\. **Brand Story Snippet** (150-200 words) {#2.-brand-story-snippet-(150-200-words)}

- Condensed version of your About Us  
- Link to full story

#### 3\. **Collection Highlights** (100-150 words per featured collection) {#3.-collection-highlights-(100-150-words-per-featured-collection)}

- Feature 3-4 top collections  
- Brief story for each

#### 4\. **Trust Signals** (100-150 words) {#4.-trust-signals-(100-150-words)}

- Italian craftsmanship  
- Worldwide shipping  
- Customer testimonials

#### Content Examples {#content-examples}

**Good Wild Donkey Copy (100 words):**  
"Our vintage hoodies are handcrafted recreations of iconic American originals. Each hoodie begins with authentic pieces discovered in flea markets worldwide – from faded college hoodies to revolutionary graphic hoodies from the '60s protests. In our Italian workshop, artisans faithfully reproduce these treasures, creating unisex hoodies with period-correct prints and our signature aging process. Whether you choose heavyweight hoodies for layering or lighter graphic hoodies for year-round wear, each piece captures genuine counterculture spirit. These aren't just vintage hoodies – they're wearable history, individually aged to feel like treasured finds from day one."

## Appendix: Competitor Analysis Methodology {#appendix:-competitor-analysis-methodology}

### How We Developed These Recommendations {#how-we-developed-these-recommendations}

**1\. Keyword Identification Process**

- Analysed Wild Donkey's keyword strategy CSV file  
- Identified the highest monthly search volume (MSV) keyword for each collection  
- Example: "hoodies" (74,000 MSV) for the Hoodies collection

**2\. Competitor Research Methodology** We analysed 50+ collection pages from top-ranking UK fashion retailers, including:

- **Mass Market**: ASOS, Next, UNIQLO, TK Maxx  
- **Specialty Retailers**: Village Hats, Community Clothing, Superdry  
- **Premium Brands**: House of Fraser, Coach, Tory Burch  
- **Sustainable/Niche**: Rains, Community Clothing, A.P.C.

**3\. Content Analysis Framework** For each competitor page, we measured:

- Exact word count of intro/hero copy  
- Keyword placement and density  
- Content structure and elements used  
- Unique value propositions highlighted

**4\. Key Findings That Shaped Our Strategy**

**Finding 1: Brevity is Standard**

- Average intro copy: 50-150 words  
- ASOS uses only 95 words for hoodies  
- Even premium brands keep it under 200 words

**Finding 2: Formula for Success** The most successful pages follow this pattern:

1. Need/occasion statement  
2. Variety/range emphasis  
3. Use case or styling tips  
4. Brand or quality differentiators

**Finding 3: Wild Donkey's Opportunity** Unlike competitors who rely on:

- Domain authority (ASOS, Next)  
- Brand variety (House of Fraser)  
- Price (TK Maxx)

Wild Donkey can win with:

- Authentic vintage storytelling  
- Italian craftsmanship narrative  
- Limited edition positioning  
- Cultural/historical context

**5\. SEO Integration Patterns** Successful sites naturally include keywords by:

- Using them in the first sentence  
- Including variations (hoodie/hoodies)  
- Adding descriptors (vintage, graphic, oversized)  
- Maintaining conversational tone

### Why This Approach Works for Wild Donkey {#why-this-approach-works-for-wild-donkey}

While major retailers can rank with minimal content due to their domain authority, Wild Donkey needs a different strategy:

1. **Target Long-tail Keywords**: "vintage hoodies" over generic "hoodies"  
2. **Provide Unique Value**: Stories competitors can't tell  
3. **Build Topic Authority**: Become the go-to for vintage authenticity  
4. **Create Shareable Content**: Stories that inspire social sharing

This research-backed approach balances SEO requirements with Wild Donkey's unique brand story, helping you compete where you're strongest rather than trying to outrank giants on generic terms.
