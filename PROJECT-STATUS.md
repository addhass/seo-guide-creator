## 🚧 Current Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Test Find Competitors with user's DataForSEO credentials
   - [ ] Test Product Analysis functionality
   - [ ] Test Guide Generation with user's Anthropic API key
   - [ ] End-to-end workflow testing

2. **Server Updates Needed**
   - [ ] Modify server endpoints to fetch user's API keys from Supabase
   - [ ] Add proper authentication headers to API requests
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting per user

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Clean up remaining test files
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create user onboarding guide
- [ ] Add error handling for expired/invalid keys

### Low Priority
- [ ] Implement proper encryption (replace base64)
- [ ] Add usage tracking and limits
- [ ] Create admin dashboard
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## 🔍 Known Issues

1. **API Key Usage**: Server endpoints still use environment variables instead of user's stored keys
2. **No Session Management**: Need to pass user context to server for API calls
3. **Basic Encryption**: Using base64 encoding instead of proper encryption

## 📊 Technical Debt

- Remove all test/debug files from production
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add comprehensive logging
- Create automated tests
- Document API endpoints

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - Update server to use Supabase for API keys
   - Test complete workflow with user credentials
   - Fix any integration issues

2. **Short-term** (This Week):
   - Complete all integration testing
   - Create user documentation
   - Prepare for beta launch

3. **Long-term** (Next Month):
   - Implement usage analytics
   - Add team/organization features
   - Create billing integration

## 📈 Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: ~60% (needs improvement)
- **Security Score**: B+ (improved from D)
- **Performance**: Good (page load < 2s)
- **User Experience**: Needs testing

## 🎯 Definition of Done

The project will be considered production-ready when:
1. All high-priority tasks are complete
2. Full end-to-end testing passes
3. Security vulnerabilities are resolved
